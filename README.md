# About

---

Amazon Go is the first store of its kind where you don’t need to check out from the store. Customers can simply enter the store using the Amazon Go app to browse and take the products they want and can leave. How cool is that? Amazon Go store is partially automated where customers don’t need to stand in a queue for check-out counters.

# How does it Works ?

---

To get started, you just need an Amazon account and a smartphone. You have to scan the app as you enter the store. You can then put away your phone and begin shopping - picking up items, putting them in a basket or in bags (without needing to scan each item). You can just simply walk out when you're finished. The money debits automatically from your amazon wallet.

You don't need to check out and you can replace items at any time.

# Technologies used
# 1. Computer Vision

---

Computer Vision is a field of study that seeks to develop techniques to help computers “see” and understand the content of digital images such as photographs and videos. For example, we can use a trained computer to identify fruits. The images will be captured by a digital camera and fed to our rained computer. Our trained computer will use either machine learning or deep learning to identify fruits in those images.

# Computer Vision has three objectives:
# 1.1 Object Classification

---

Object classification is related to computer vision and image processing that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class in digital images and videos. Imagine we have an image of vegetables and fruits on a shelf. Now, our algorithm will classify each object into fruit a=or vegetable.

# 1.2 Object Identification

---

Object identification refers to identifying the unique characteristics of an object. Instead of classifying objects into fruit and vegetable only, the algorithm tries to find which fruit or vegetable is present in our image.
